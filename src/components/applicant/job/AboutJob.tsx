                You will be the first or one of the first sales professionals at Teller, meaning that there is little to
                no process, playbook, or motion already defined for you. It's your job to create it. If you are someone
                that's used to selling from behind a well-known logo and being a cog in a well oiled go-to-market
                machine do not apply for this job, you will not be successful here (although feel free to come back in
                12-18 months). However, if you want to roll your sleeves up, work your backside off, work directly with
                the CEO, and be promoted and progressed as far as your antitude and ability allows then this might be
                the place for
